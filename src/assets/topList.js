        paragraph: 'Welcome to Mars, marine! Things around here are a little different than you may be used to, so grab a chair and listen up. In 2001 Earth made contact with life on Mars. After proceeding cautiously it was determined that the inhabitants of Mars were friendly, and we have been in a symbiotic relationship since then. We share our increasing knowledge of crop growth, and they share their invaluable Power Crystals. 6 months ago we received a distress signal from our Martian friends. They fell under attack by another alien species who wanted to conquer them for the Crystals. It is in Earth\'s best interest to assist our friends in protecting Mars as we benefit greatly from their Crystals and the lack of inter-spacial war convening here on Earth.',

These are used to purchase new ships and upgrades in the Game Menu. Blue Power Crystals are much more rare, and they give off a very high level of energy, but only for a short time. These are used to power your ships advanced features such as powerful weapons and evasive maneuvers. Due to how quickly they lose their energy after being mined, these Blue Crystals aren\'t worth anything by the end of the mission and are thrown away. Use it or lose it.',

If you don\'t want your current ammo stack, you may sell it for 1 Crystal per ammo. Attacking enemies with ammo hurts them without hurting you, unlike moving over the enemy. One attack will spend as much ammo as is necessary to kill the enemy, or all of it if there isn\'t enough. An enemy killed in this way will drop Crystals. Types of ammo include bullets and rockets. If you\'re lucky, you might find some ammo with special properties. Ammo provides the same bonus to you, regardless of your ship. Picking up new ammo will replace your old ammo (without giving you Crystals in return).',

Most ships have "bonus actions" which are free actions (they still cost Blue Crystals to activate) that don\'t count against your Action Total.

To remove an Enemy, you must deal damage equal to or exceeding their health. If you do this with ammo or with an Action, the Enemy will disappear and leave behind a stash of Crystals. If you move over an Enemy due to not having any ammo, you will take damage equal to the Enemy\'s remaining health and if you survive, you will stay in the new location. If your ship does not survive, you will be taken prisoner and the mission will end (you do not lose anything, the mission just ends. You can even keep the Green Crystals you have collected).',

Friendly Structures will provide you with some benefit for moving over them such as health, ammo, crystals, etc. Enemy structures will be deal damage to you equal to their value, but will always leave you with at least 1 armor. Moving over an Enemy Structure may have additional effects, such as taking some of your Blue Crystals or ammo. Enemy Structures cannot be damaged by ammo, but can be damaged by some Actions. Neutral Structures can be good or bad. One type of Neutral Structure is a Crystal Field that provides a large amount of Green Crystals. Another type is a Mountain that does not hurt you and you cannot normally move over it. It simply gets in the way until you use an Action or a Friendly Structure that can remove it.',
